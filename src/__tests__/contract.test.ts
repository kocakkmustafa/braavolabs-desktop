/**
 * DRIFT-GUARD (audit C3). The CLI and Desktop API clients are "verbatim ports"
 * of one another, but nothing stopped them from silently diverging — and they
 * DID: sign-out on Desktop used to clear local tokens WITHOUT calling
 * /auth/logout, so the refresh token stayed valid server-side (the exact hole
 * R3 closed on the CLI + web). This test pins the SHARED contract every
 * authenticated Braavolabs surface must honour, so the next divergence fails CI
 * instead of shipping silently. Keep this list byte-identical to the CLI's
 * `contract.test.ts` — that duplication IS the guard: one canonical contract,
 * asserted independently in each repo. Surface-specific endpoints (media = CLI,
 * memory = Desktop) are intentional and deliberately NOT asserted here.
